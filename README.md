#### Hi, my name is Shangqing Yuan.  Im from China.  And my background is Electronic Engineering.  I'm super excited about what the combination of design and technology will produce. Openframeworks is a great starting point from where I hope to create something incredible with the intersection of Arduino, industrial design, interaction design and even projection mapping. Hope to make things happen.
